                <div>
                    Hello, I'm Danny! To keep this concise, I have an interest in all things tech and always have a
                    passion
                    for
                    learning how and why things works as well as maybe if it can "pushed" beyond
                    what it was intended. I'm a computer science major with an interest ranging from cybersecurity to
                    the
                    cloud,
                    and one of my goals is to be a generalist where I can work with all things tech.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This page serves to show a little of who I am behind the professional mask, and to help compile my
                    activities, hobbies, and whatever I feel would be nice to show off to the internet!

                12/23/24: planning on building out my website, currently very sparse and not the best looking for sure,
                hoping
                to get out a very basic version at the very least!
