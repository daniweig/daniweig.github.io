About Me

Hello, I'm Danny! To keep this concise, I have an interest in all things tech and always have a passion for learning how and why things works as well as maybe if it can "pushed" beyond
what it was intended. I'm a computer science major with an interest ranging from cybersecurity to the cloud, and one of my goals is to be a generalist where I can work with all things tech.

This page serves to show a little of who I am behind the professional mask, and to help compile my activities, hobbies, and whatever I feel would be nice to show off to the internet!
