Homelab

Currently have a simple homelab setup. I'm running a proxmox server on an old thinkpad to host random VMs, game servers, and  learning cool IT stuff.
I'm hoping to upgrade and build my own lab to run more beefier setup and learn more as I go. 

lockpicking

Since middle school, I thought lockpicking was a cool activity. Even now, I still think so. It is an fun activity that has a practical use as well. While many think lockpicking is a criminal 
activity, it is a useful skill whenever you lock yourself out of a room, car, or even a house lol. Even then, criminals will use the path of least resistant and just break the window!
